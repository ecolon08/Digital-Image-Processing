**Example 3.13 from DIPUM - HPF from LPF** --> **need to generate a 2D FIR filter, but don't know how to do this in Python... Import coefficients from Matlab?**

Gonzalez et al. generated a length-129 FIR filter using Matlab which we will use in the following example.

#######################
# HIGH PASS FILTERS
#######################

#load the lowpass kernel
with open('lpkernel1D.txt') as lp1d_file:
    #read fir coeff
    data = lp1d_file.read()
    
    #split string
    data = list(data.split(','))
    
    #convert strings to floats
    wLP1D = [float(coeff) for coeff in data]
    
#convert to numpy array
wLP1D = np.asarray(wLP1D).reshape(-1,1)

#create 2D kernel by computing the outer product - This assumes that our filter kernel is separable, but we know that only Gaussian kernels are separable
wLP2D = wLP1D @ np.transpose(wLP1D)
